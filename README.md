ResistanceV2
Simple real time chat application. Following are the core functionalities of the

app:

1.The app is to be divided into two sections. The sidebar should give options to Broadcast

message, save messages and Log out. Clicking on Broadcast message should open a Modal

box to input the required message. Messages should be limited to 200 characters. You have to

log in/sign up to broadcast messages and add comments. Sign­up email id’s should be unique.

2.The main section should display the message feed.

3.John Connor is the admin. His messages should be highlighted as shown in the app mockup.

People should be able to comment on these messages. They should be also able to save a

message for future reference.

4.Messages of other resistance leaders should NOT be highlighted. Moreover, people have the

option to approve or disapprove their messages. (See the tick and cross icon). There should be

a count of how many people have approved or disapproved a message. Note that this option

should NOT be available for John Connor as he is the admin and all his commands are to be

accepted as it is.

5.You can hide and show comments.

6.You should be able to view saved messages.

7.You can use a placeholder image for profile pics.
